## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. The text that you are looking at now is not a part of any code - it is perceived by R as simple text that helps to guide viewers through a page of code. R will only run code that is denoted by apostrophes and curly brackets you see in the below boxes. 

On the lefthand side of each code box, you will see arrows to the right of the line numbers. Clicking on these arrows will collapse or expand the section. Try clicking the arrows in the code box below. Once you have done that, click the double arrows to re-expand the code box. 

```{r Test collapse box}

```

Below is a chunk of R code. You can run R code in several ways: 

* Place your cursor on the line of R code that you want to run, then press `control + enter` (PC) or `command + enter` (Mac). Your R code should appear in the console, followed by any output generated by the code. 

* Highlight line(s) of R code, then press `control + enter` (PC) or `command + enter` (Mac). Your R code should appear in the console, followed by any output generated by the code. This is a good option if you want to run multiple lines of code at once.

* Press the green arrow in the upper right portion of the code box to run the entire chunk of code at once. 


```{r Introduction to running code}

# Basic math
1 + 1
1 - 1
2 * 2
1 / 2
1 / 200 * 30
5 + 2 * 3
(5 + 2) * 3

# Common terms
sqrt(25)
sin(pi)

# Summary statistics
mean(c(5, 4, 6, 4, 6,7,3, 8, 10))
median(c(5, 4, 6, 4, 6, 7, 3, 8, 10))

# Conditional statements
4 > 5
4 < 5
4 != 5
4 == 5

```

Did you notice something different about the mean and median codes? They have the letter c in them. This c stands for concatenate, which means "link a group of items together in a chain or series. The purpose is to tell R to run the mean and median function for every item in the series and not just the first item in the parentheses. Try running the below code when I don't include the concatenate indication.

```{r Without Concatenate}
# Summary statistics

mean(5, 4, 6, 4, 6,7,3, 8, 10)
median(5, 4, 6, 4, 6, 7, 3, 8, 10)

```

You may also choose to type or paste R code directly into the console. This is not a recommended method, as it undermines the goals of reproducibility (code is not saved). However, typing directly into the console can be useful if you need to do something that is strictly temporary (e.g., look at a summary of a data set or determine the class of a variable)

Try copy and pasting some of the above code (or a new code) directly into the console below to try out the console functionality. 

### Objects
You can create R objects with an *assignment* statement. The indicator for an assignment is the `<-` symbol. A good way to think about the meaning of an assignment statement is "object name (left-hand side) gets value (right-hand side)."

A quick note: in many situations, a `=` sign will substitute for a `<-`. Resist this temptation! This will be confusing later, when `=` means something else. 

Go ahead and run the lines of code below. Notice that both objects have also just shown up in your Environment tab to the upper right of your R screen. 

```{r Assigning Objects}

myString <- "Hello, World!"

x <- 3*4

motivation <- "You're doing a great job! Take a deep breath, give yourself a high five, and keep moving forward."
```

Now, call the objects `x` and 'motivation' by running the code below. 


```{r}

myString 

x 

motivation

```
###Comments

Comments are text you can include in your code to guide viewers through different aspects of your code. (They are especially helpful when you haven't looked at your code in a few days/weeks/months and are wanting to re-familiarize yourself with your work.) Use the # symbol to begin a comment - any text written after the # will be ignored by the interpreter while executing your actual code.

Your editor will display this comment as a different color to indicate it will not be run in the console. Comments can be placed on their own lines or at the end of a line of code.

```{r}

myString #It is a convention to print "Hello, World!" as your first code when programming. 

x 

motivation # I recommend printing this object whenever you are feeling stressed or overwhelmed

```


### Naming
R objects can be named with a combination of letters, numbers, underscore (`_`) and period (`.`). The best R object names are *informative*. Resist the temptation to call your R object something convenient, like "a", "b", and so on. Calling your R object something specific means that you can call up that object later and have an idea of what it contains, with less need for specific context. 

Informative names are the first illustration of a common data management recommendation: take the time to use best management practices at the outset, and it will save you time in the long term. 

Note: you may never call an R object "data". This word is reserved for a specific function and may not be assigned as a name. To work around this, many people call their R objects "dat", which is another example of a less-than-ideal data management practice because it is not informative. 

Run the first line of code below. Then, type in "long" below it and press `tab`. What happens?

```{r}
long_name_for_illustration <- 11

#Enter long below

```

### Functions
R functions are the major tool used in R. Functions can do virtually unlimited things within the R universe, but each function requires specific inputs that are provided under specific arrangement of words and/or characters. We will start with a simple function that is built into R, `seq`

```{r}
seq(1, 10)
ten_sequence <- seq(1, 10) #from, to
ten_sequence
(ten_sequence <- seq(1, 10))

seq(1, 10, 2) # from, to, by
```

### Getting help within R
In many ways, the help functionality in R is limited by the fact that you need to have a good understanding of specific functions for the help to be useful. Google and Stack Overflow are often more helpful than the help within R.

For now, here are some ways to access the help tools in R: 

* Within the below R chunk, type in `??function`, substitution the word 'function' for your desired function. This will bring up the help pane in the notebook and show you entries of help files with the word 'function in them. In this case, we can substitute the seq function we used above.

* In the console, type in `help(function)`. This will bring up the help pane in the notebook at the page for your specific function. Typing `?function` will produce the same result. 

* Navigate to the help pane in the notebook and type the function into the search bar.

```{r}
??seq

help(seq)

?seq
```


## TIPS AND TRICKS

* Spaces (generally) don't matter. One notable exception is that spaces within quotation marks *do* matter.

* Case matters

* Parentheses and quotation marks appear in pairs when typed into RStudio. 

* When typing long names, use the `tab` key partway through the name to generate auto-complete options. 
* In the upper right corner of the editor is a button with multiple horizontal lines. Clicking this button will bring up the outline of the document. Headings in the outline are determined by how you've defined them in the document (i.e. through the use of #s to define Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3)
